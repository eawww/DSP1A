CHANGES
  20150218 - (Eric) Created working Date class. string copy constructor still doesn't work (outside of VS) but that's okay just turn
  stuff like Date newDate = "20150218"; into something like Date newDate; newDate = "20150218"; All inequality operators turn Date objects into
  integers and compare them. (Most recent git push to newDate_h branch)
  
  20150219 - (John) Created two classes for the assigned and completed assignments. Changed the assignment.h to a struct. Created a linked list class. Looked at the doubly linked list source code on blakcboard and implemented functions needed. Removed non necessary files or duplicates.

  20150221 - (Eric) Separated Date.h into Date.h and Date.cpp for copmpiling ease. Tested with testDate() function in main.
  Changed isLate in Assignment to enum status {ASSIGNED, COMPLETED, LATE} as suggested on assignment sheet.
  Gave menu.cpp a menu.h file because the linker wanted to kill me
  Wrote a temporary readFile() function in menu.cpp that works with the current methods. It will need a parser to read the expected input.
	Also it assumes the things in the file are already ordered since, obviously, they'll be ordered when we write them to the file.
  For simplicity in figuring out menus and whatnot, I changed the input lines to the format
	YYYYMMDD oneworddescription YYYYMMDD STATUS
	We'll have to write or use a parser to get strings out from between the commas but I think it's good for now
  Wrote print list function that prints a STL list of Assignment objects with my date class.
  While including Assignment.h, Date.cpp, Date.h, main.cpp, menu.cpp, menu.h in my project, it compiled and I
	was able to navigate to the displaySubmenu and print both assigned and completed lists.
  I should write a function for my Date class to convert the Date into a string and use that for the << operator so
	it can be used with iomanip things.
  Added a ==int operator to Date class basically to tell if a date is blank. if (Date == 0) then it's blank

  20150227 - (Eric) Upgraded file reading functions to parse format specified on assignment since that's probably what they'll use
  while grading. Also added parseDate(string) function to menu to convert to a usable format.
  Changed << operator on Date class to simply convert the date to an integer and inject the result into the stream. It should now work with iomanip
  functions.

  20150228 - (Eric) Added a whole bunch of comments so you can understand what's going on.
  Implemented addAssignment() function from addSubmenu. Operates differently depending on bool parameter
  which specifies which list it is modifying. As of right now, it works if all input is as expected.
  Added save() function. Successfully writes both lists to file with no trailing whitespace.
  Added checkLate() function. Prints all late assignments and the total number of late assignments.
  Offset list printing by one space to distinguish from collumn headers.

  20150302 - Finished edit function just in case John doesn't.
